This chapter intends to introduce the main objects and concepts in TensorFlow.  We also 
introduce how to access the data for the rest of the book and provide additional resources
for learning about TensorFlow.

TensorFlow如何工作
=================

Here we introduce TensorFlow and the general outline of how most TensorFlow algorithms work.
 
变量和张量的声明
===============

How to create and initialize tensors in TensorFlow.  We also depict how these operations appear in Tensorboard.

使用占位符和变量
===============

How to create and use variables and placeholders in TensorFlow.  We also depict how these operations appear in Tensorboard.



矩阵
======

Understanding how TensorFlow can work with matrices is crucial to understanding how the algorithms work.

操作符的声明
===========

How to use various mathematical operations in TensorFlow.

载入激活函数
