Taking TensorFlow to Production
===============================

Implementing Unit Tests
-----------------------

We show how to implement different types of unit tests on tensors (placeholders and variables).

Using Multiple Executors (Devices)
----------------------------------

How to use a machine with multiple devices.  E.g., a machine with a CPU, and one or more GPUs.

Parallelizing TensorFlow
-------------------------

How to setup and use TensorFlow distributed on multiple machines.

Tips for TensorFlow in Production
----------------------------------

Various tips for developing with TensorFlow

An Example of Productionalizing TensorFlow
-------------------------------------------

We show how to do take the RNN model for predicting ham/spam (from Chapter 9, recipe #2) and put 
it in two production level files: training and evaluation.
