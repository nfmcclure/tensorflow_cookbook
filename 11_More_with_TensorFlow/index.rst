Visualizing Computational Graphs (with Tensorboard)
===================================================

An example of using histograms, scalar summaries, and creating images in Tensorboard.

Working with a Genetic Algorithm
=================================

We create a genetic algorithm to optimize an individual (array of 50 numbers) toward the 
ground truth function.

Clustering Using K-means
========================

How to use TensorFlow to do k-means clustering.  We use the Iris data set, set k=3, and use
k-means to make predictions.

Solving a System of ODEs
========================

Here, we show how to use TensorFlow to solve a system of ODEs.  The system of concern is the 
Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system.

Using a Random Forest
=======================

We illustrate how to use TensorFlow's gradient boosted regression and classification trees.

Using TensorFlow with Keras
=============================

Here we show how to use the Keras sequential model building for a fully connected neural
network and a CNN model with callbacks.
